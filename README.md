## Cool Projects
I am currently trying to teach other early professionals how professional development is done. 
To aid in thsi task, I have created the BizziQuest organization, and am currently 
going through my backlog of unfinushed project ideas and using them to teach others! I am using
agile methodologies (as actually applied in the real world), enforcing code style and best practices,
and actually explainign these things to others. If you would like to get soem real-world experience,
or just want to lend a hand, join the [BizziQuest organization](https://github.com/organizations/BizziQuest)!
