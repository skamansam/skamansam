### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Samuel C Tyler and I have been passionate about
web application development since 1996! However, my
Professional work did not start until 2007. I love
learning new things, so am constantly adding to my
programming toolbox, which already contains modern JavaScript,
Ruby (w/ Rails), :python: Python (w/ Django), Perl, and PHP. My
next venture is Go, to be used for Kubernetes monitoring
and microservice orchestration. I currently work as a 
full-stack developer, who sometimes wears a DevOps hat.
